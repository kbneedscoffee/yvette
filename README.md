# Yvette
Yvette is a short Choose Your Own Adventure game about the basics of research data management.

I created Yvette in part to learn [Twine](https://twinery.org/), but also to help me teach the basics of research data management in a new way. I opted for a scenario-based learning experience via a CYOA game. 

Research data management can be a very dry subject, so I wanted to make it into a short and digestible interactive experience. I tried to capture realistic scenarios where learners could also see themselves in Yvette. 

The images of Yvette, Dr. Grant, and the research librarian were built with Pablo Stanley's incredible resource [OpenPeeps](https://www.openpeeps.com/).
